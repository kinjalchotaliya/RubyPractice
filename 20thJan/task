Computer will guess a number. Between 50 to 150.

User should have 10 tries to identify that number.

If the user enters a lower number then selected then give a message like this is “This is lesser then selected number” and if the user enters higher number then selected show message like “This is greater then selected number”.

Suppose computer guess 64.

User enters 55 then show message “This is laser then selected number”

User enters 65 then show message “This is greater than selected number”

And if user gives correct number at 5th attempt then show this message → “Congratulations, You got the number <number> in 5 attempts(try)”

Or if user not able to provide correct number in 10 tries then show message like “You lose this game”

4. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.



5. Game

    Accept number of players n - integer
    Accept difference d - integer
    Assume a circle consisting of all the players
    Name the players starting from Player-1 to Player-n
    Move in the circle and start eliminating every player who is at the count of d. This has to be continued unless only one player remains in the circle. The remaining player is the winner.
    For example, For n = 10 and d = 3
    Players: Player-1....Player-10
    The players will be eliminated in the following order:
    Player-3 (Because this player is at 3rd position from Player-1)
    Player-6
    Player-9
    Player-2
    Player-7
    Player-1
    Player-8
    Player-5
    Player-10

                   1   2
                10        ~~3~~
            9                   4
                8           5
                    7   6

                    1   2
                10        ~~3~~
            9                   4
                8           5
                    7 ~~6~~

                    1   2
                10        ~~3~~
          ~~9~~                 4
                8           5
                    7 ~~6~~

                    1 ~~2~~
                10        ~~3~~
          ~~9~~                 4
                8           5
                    7 ~~6~~

                    1 ~~2~~
                10        ~~3~~
          ~~9~~                 4
                8           5
                  ~~7~~ ~~6~~


This continues until the last player remains.



6. It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

4 + 1

3 + 2

3 + 1 + 1

2 + 2 + 1

2 + 1 + 1 + 1

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can N be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?

OR

6.  Input a number and find the next number as per below rule:

    The next number in the sequence read off the digits of the given number, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit

For example, Input - 1 Output - 11 (i.e. one occurrence of 1)

Input - 11 Output - 21 (i.e. two occurrences of 1)

Input - 21 Output - 1211 (i.e. one occurrence of 2 and one occurrence of 1)

Input - 1211 Output - 111221 (i.e. one occurrence of 1 and one occurrence of 2 and two occurrences of 1)
